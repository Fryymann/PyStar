## Interstellar Travel

- using extremely large amounts of power to operate massive devices that creates a sort of "hole" in gravity when linked with a corresponding device at the other end.
- these devices use gravity to create tunnels that allow certain crafts to travel through them at faster than light speeds.

- GRAVITRONIC TRANSMITTER

- the amount of fusion power required to power these "gates" is so immense, there is the theoretical risk of creating a black hole if the integrity of the power generators were to be comprimised.

- the area outside of the gate is a sprawling metropolis of massive space stations that eventually merged together to form the largest space structure in history.
